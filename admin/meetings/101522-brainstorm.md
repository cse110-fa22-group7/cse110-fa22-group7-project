## Discussed:

- Basic Plan: Twitter Backup
  - Store and manage tweets locally to keep your content your own. even if banned.

- C reate
  - User can input text to create a new tweet which will be stored locally
    - Reach: user can download tweets from their twitter account to create local posts on the site
  - Potentially have posts uploaded to a database to sync content between devices
- R ead
  - Gallery view of all users posts - endless scroll / search? 
- U pdate
  - User can select posts from the list and edit their content
- D elete
  - user can delete posts from the list

- Sync between devices
  - requires a database containing a list of users/passwords and linking them to their posts.

- Reach goals:
  - expand to account for other types of media: tweets can have pictures, links, videos, etc.
  - button to post to twitter or other social networks
  - single button which will download all tweets from a users account, syncing their account on the site and on twitter.
