## What was discussed 

### ADR
    Before we continue coding, we need to go back and document our archictecture.  This will help us understand what code actually needs to be written and how the backend/frontend should work and integrate.  This will be our focus on wednesday, after which we will plan out the next coding sprint.

### CI/CD Pipeline
    This weeks lab goes over the CI/CD stuff, go through the lab and work on getting our pipeline setup for future work and feature implementation

### Unit testing
    future features should have unit tests created.  Every feature should have a set of tests it must pass before being merged into the main branch.
