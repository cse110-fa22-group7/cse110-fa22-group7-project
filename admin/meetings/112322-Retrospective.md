# Retrospective 2

8:15-8:30

## The Good
On the same page this sprint - more transparent and clear with goals allowed people to get there work done

More people attending and participating in meetings made discussion better

Most of the core functionality of the webite was accomplished

Having the people assigned directly on the project board made it more clear who was doing what and who to reach out to when working on interconnected components.

Most of the work got done in the first couple days of sprint.

Splitting the team by feature rather than backend/frontend was more successful

## The Bad
Had mild trouble sticking to the CI/CD pipeline

Some features still don't have test cases:
Want tests to be ready before features are pushed, in this next sprint.
