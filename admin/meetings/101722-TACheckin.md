## Meetings Notes:

### Meeting attendance!
  - participation is very important for learning, and for grade.
  - Make sure to show up to monday meetings its important time to asks questions to the TA about anything from the project to labs to deadlines etc.
  - If unable to attend meetings reach out to someone who was and they can go over it with you as some details might be missing from the notes.

### Wednesday Meeting
  - The TA is planning on using this time for every team to go over the canvas assignments.  As this is the one time we were able to get everyone together they suggested we attend the beginning of the meeting and them split of into our own section.  
  - Make sure to go over whatever canvas assignments are coming up **beforehand**, ad we can ask our questions right away to get the most out of the conversation.
  - Will probably stay for like 10-20 and then finish the rest of the hour in our own meeting.

### Pitching our plan on Monday
  - Show how our project fulfills the requirements for the project
  
### Daily standups starting tomorrow
  - You will recieve a message on slack, respond to it to submit your standup, the board should then be publiclly visisble so everyone can see what everyone else is working on.



## Left for discussion:

- Make sure to go over brainstorming assignment on canvas, during the wednesday meeting we will continue the process we started last friday, and tailor it more towards fulfilling the assignements reqs.
-   
- After we've finished our brainstorming, we will go over the proposal as we are going to be pitching our project to the TA on monday and then again on canvas.
