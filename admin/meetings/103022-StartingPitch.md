## What was discussed 

## Wireframes
We are finishing up the wireframes if you did not attend the meeting please view them to familiarize yourself with it. They are on the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AxV4t2-UCEHW6sqbZame35coyHRNIMl-WlhdR3YxxIU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Building a belt
We will put an html file for the main page in source called main.html. This is so that pushes can go to this file and reflect on a website via github pages.
## What is left to be discussed
Coding will start next week. Very important that you attend next meeting so that we can see what is expected in our code. App name also needs to be decided
