## What was completed

### Sprint 3
This sprint will be the most intensive sprint we have much to do so expect a larger workload. 

### ADRS
ADRS are NECESSARY before you start coding a feature please work with your partner to develop a proper ADR. ADRS we need create and edit popups, filtering, general design changes. We worked on ADRS for these and are completed.

### Ci cd pipeline
Need to pass all the checks. All checks are shown in /admin/cipipline/phase1.md. If your code fails these tests the fix is somewhat simple you need to run the code given in main.yml in .github/workflows/main.yml . Make sure to do npm install first so that your computer has these packages.

### Next meeting
We need to have a meeting again to discuss progress a when2meet was sent out make sure you look at that
