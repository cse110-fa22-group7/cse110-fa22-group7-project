## Meeting Notes

## Starting Pitch Advice
- keep journalism ideas  
- go with website instead of app  
- Flow  
    - user logs into account  
        - sign up using google   
        - once logged in have a button for a post  
            - after post is created put in storage   
            - once updated write search query have last updated column updated  
            - Delete post  
                - asks are you sure you want to delete  
                - if yes in backend search for post by id and delete   
- Use least amount of words for post (post limit) 
- Labels and keywords to pinpoint posts
    - list selector to select labels
    - automatically update
    - make sure page gets refreshed after label creation
    -don’t let user create custom labels 
- Calendar might be too complex (save for the end)
	- once date is clicked show posts from that day 
- Update post 
    - update last updated date on backend
- daily checkin is too complex (won't do)
	- don’t send reminder if already posted
	- keep feature towards the end
- export posts to other sites too complex (won't do)
- Design
    - search bar to search for label
    - Keep it on one system
    - post id
    - Local storage
