# Retrospective sprint 1
### Date and time

## What was discussed 
### Backend 
Backend group: Jacob, Anh, Yaosen, Hongkun, Neal
Did start with mob programming. Biggest issue tackled was finding a time where everyone was available to meet. Trouble to get people to responsd to the when2meet. Things that can go better are more proactive communication. Needed to start much earlier. Did need to do ADRs before we started coding. Pair programming would've been a good idea for more accountability to meet with each other. In this sprint noone made any commits, noone had done what they were assigned except for Yaosen and Jacob. Biggest issue was communication, finding time to meet, and holding people accountable for their work. Pair programming might be better 
### Frontend 
Frontend group: Lucas, Rita, Beomsu, Jenny
Started with mob programming which was good since it was the first starting point and the base. We could all see how things started so in the future we could split up. Meeting together initially created a good foundation. Everyone showed and engaged and participated. 

### Overall reflection
We were able to break down goals into smaller goals to fit our sprint planning. ADRS should've been done before coding. In future sprints ADR's should be done for each feature before coding.
