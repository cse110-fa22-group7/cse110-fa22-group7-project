# Filters

## Problem Statement
Posts need to be filtered by label or date. 

## Considerations

### Filter by one or multiple labels?
Since posts created only have one label we might consider filtering by just one label. The point of the filters is to focus on one of the emotions so multiple emotions makes less sense.

### What should we filter by?
The options we discussed are by dates or by label. 
### Implementation for by label
Each post object has a label associated get the post label. Function that accepts just the label string. Array of posts and make a subarray of just the posts with the certain label and show that subarray in the posts section.
### Implementation for by date
To filter by dates use a function to compare date strings.
### Edge cases
After label is selected what if another post is created? Should all posts be showed or just the posts of the label? 
### Clear/Reset Button
If we no longer want to view posts by an emotion we can have a clear or reset button that makes it so that the post section shows all posts again.
## What we discussed
### Solution to edge case
A new filter refresh function.
### Final Decision
We should first try to implement by label and if time permits add filter by date. Filtering by dates shouldn't be too hard.
