# General Designs

## Problem Statement
Make sure the layout is user friendly.

## Considerations

### Filter design
Should we keep all filtering options visible at all times or should we convert it into a dropdown? 

### Dropdown
Labels can be shown as buttons once the dropdown is shown. Labels can either be shown as buttons or checkboxes
### Color theme
Background could be darker than the wireframe and buttons can be different colors. Button shape and text can be the same as the wireframes
### Post spacing
Posts can have a border, spacing, and potentially a backdrop between them to make them visually seperate.
### Label colors
Labels can be different colors based on the emotions. Should be colored on both posts and filter dropdown. Same border/ button color? Same shapes? 
Should popup label select also have these colors?
### Style
Make sure all the style go through the page as you're scrolling and fill the entire window.
### Buttons
Buttons should change visually when hovered over or clicked by darkening the background of the button. 
## What we discussed

### Final Decisions
Make sure the text is readable. Decided to keep labels in the dropdown buttons.
