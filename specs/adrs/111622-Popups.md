# Create and Edit popups

## Problem statement

We need to show create and edit popups on respective button clicks. Need to get the information inputed in the popup to update the text and label values.

## Considerations 
### CSS 
Position needs to be fixed so that in can stay in the center of the screen should use 50% on left and right instead of pixel values. Try to position. 

### Overlay
Should gray out the rest of the screen should use a div overlay and set it to active when the popup shows. 

### HTML 
Make the different popups different classes. Use the dialog tag to make the popup a modal. 

### Changing color of popup
In order to make sure the popup does not blend in make the popup a different color.

### Active or not active
Popup appears when the element is set to active and is hidden otherwise.

### Backend implementation
Information should be taken in by eventhandler by input submit event. This will create/edit the post object and set the data equal to the input in the popup. 

### Cancel buttons
On both popups cancel button should take the user back to the homepage.

### Dialog Modal to blur screen
The dialog tag allows to modal created to blur/darken the rest of the screen.
## What we discussed:
Template is already there for the wireframes the wireframes have been implemented in html and css as a template.

### Final Decisions
Overlay or dialog tag (we will communicate which one we use to the team) will be used to darken the page when the popup is shown so that the popup does not blend in with the page. This means the color of the popup does not need to be changed.
