# code styling:

## Problem Statment
    
We want to keep our code consistent, so that a dev working on one document can quickly jump to another without having to get acclimated to the different styles the dev working on the other document used.

## Considered Options

###Variable Names:

```
snake_case
PascalCase
camelCase
kebab-case
```


Bracket Placement

```
while True
{

}

or 

while True{

}
```

## Decision Outcome

```
snake_case

while True
{

}
```

Also Comment Requirements

```
/* Method, File, Class Headers */

//inline comments to explain, above confusing code
```
